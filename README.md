# SDN_DDoS24
SDN-DDoS24 Dataset is generated using a real-world SDN testbed with a Cisco Nexus 5672 OpenFlow switch and a centralized RYU controller. It includes real-time normal and attack traffic for intrusion detection research. The dataset captures flow-level statistics, packet rates, and anomalies, ensuring high-fidelity DDoS detection.
